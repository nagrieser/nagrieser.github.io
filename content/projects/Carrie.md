Carrie Cox was an undergraduate Physics and Engineering student from Seattle Pacific University in Seattle, Washington.  I had the privilege to mentor her for two months as part of the CERN Summer Student Program in 2023.

## Activities during summer project

Carrie was able to learn and apply significant HEP analysis skills during her summer project:

1. Monte-Carlo Simulation of dilepton Drell-Yan production using Pythia, including additional BSM effects
2. Large-scale data processing and visualization using Python packages Pandas and MatPlotLib
3. Application of statistical inference tools to determine statistical sensitivity to BSM effects dilepton distributions
4. Development and optimization of a Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier (HGBC) using SciKit Learn to enhance leptoquark sensitivity

## Current Activity

Carrie is currently pursuing a Masters degree of Science and Instrumentation in physics at Stony Brook University.  She is also a participant in Ernest Courant Traineeship in Accelerator Science and Engineering.
