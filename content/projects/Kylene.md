Kylene Monaghan was an undergraduate Physics and Engineering student from Sewanee: University of the South in Sewanee Tenessee.  I had the privilege to mentor her for two months as part of the CERN Summer Student Program in 2025.

## Activities during summer project

Kylene was able to learn and apply significant HEP analysis skills during her summer project:

1. Monte-Carlo Simulation of Hard QCD di-jet production using Pythia, including additional BSM effects
2. Jet Reconstruction using the FastJet package
3. Large-scale data processing and visualization using ROOT's RDataframe class
4. Understanding and manipulating parton distribution functions using the LHAPDF procedures
5. Development and optimization of a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) using XGBoost to separate quark vs. gluon-initiated jets
6. Application of statistical inference tools to determine statistical sensitivity to BSM effects in di-jet distributions

There is also GitHub integration to automatically clone repositories and process them with the same options as above.

## Awards

Kylene received the [Moritz Karbach Prize](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/Collaboration_prizes/Moritz_Karbach_summer_student_prize.html) honorable mention, awarded to LHCb summer students who show excellent progression and collaboration-vital impacts during their time as summer students.

## Current Activity

Kylene is currently finishing her senior year at Sewanee, and looks to pursue a PhD in either Physics or Engineering next year.
