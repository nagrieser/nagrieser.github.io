Gabriella was an undergraduate Physics student from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.  I had the privilege to mentor her for two months as part of the CERN Summer Student Program in 2024, and then proceeded in supervision of her undergraduate capstone project during the 2024-2025 academic year.

## Activities during summer project

Gabriella was able to learn and apply significant HEP analysis skills during her summer project:

1. Large-scale data processing and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks
2. Development of binary and multi-modal machine learning classifiers to discriminate different physics topologies
3. Optimization of large computing processes by using GPU computing tools
4. Efficient and concise public presentation of highly-complex ideas to non-expert audiences

## Awards

Gabriella received the [US LHC Users Association Lightning Talk Prize](https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/9140/timetable/#b-1270-awards-concluding-remar) for her 10 minute presentation on the GNN research project.  Gabriella was the only undergraduate student to win this prize, amongst PhD student and post-doctoral presentations.  The award provided funding for Gabriella to attend a week long HEP advocacy trip to Washington D.C. to meet and encourage congresspeople and senators to continue to fully support High Energy Physics research in the United States.

## Current Activity

Gabriella is currently a PhD candidate studying Experimental Particle Physics at Michigan State University.
