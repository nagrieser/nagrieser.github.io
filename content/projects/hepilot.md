This is work in progress project to introduce a modular framework for providing RAG and LLM integration for HEP experiments. The goal is to provide good context management solution for the internal data and docs for the HEP experiments. 



## Funding 

This project is currently funded by the **Bearcats AI** Initiative from University of Cincinnati which allows me to cover API costs and development resources in addition to hire undergraduate student to help with the project.
