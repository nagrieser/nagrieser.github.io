I am an experience postdoctoral fellow in physics at the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu), as part of the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.cern.ch) at [CERN](https://cern.ch). My research is at the forefront of electroweak physics, with a particular focus on properties of the W boson. Prior to my time with LHCb, I earned my PhD at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu), where I performed a search for heavy Higgs-like particles decaying to a pair of W bosons as part of the [ATLAS Collaboration](https://atlas.cern/).

My current analysis focus is spread across electroweak and QCD projects. I am leading the first measurement of W boson helicity states in the forward region at the LHC. Looking towards the Run 3 data set, I am heavily involved in applications of Graph Neural Networks for jet flavour identification for use in electroweak and QCD measurements. I am currently the subconvener of the LHCb [Standard Model Interactions](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb_page/collaboration/organization/lhcb-conv/Physics_history_and_Sub-structure.htm) and serve as a convener of LHC Physics Centre at CERN's [Electroweak Working Group](https://lpcc.web.cern.ch/content/electroweak-precision-measurements-lhc-wg).

Beyond physics analyses, my work includes significant contributions to facilitating analysts by supporting software endeavors to improve offline data processing and operational budget optimizations. I have significant responsibilities in the LHCb offline data processing stages through activities in the [Data Processing and Analysis](https://lhcb-ap.docs.cern.ch/) project. I serve on the Steering Board of [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/), which provides a cross-experiment community of innovation and advancement of software applications for High Energy Physics needs.

The menus at the top will direct you to interesting publications, talks, and projects I have supervised.
