I am a passionate doctoral candidate in physics at the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu), deeply engaged in the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.cern.ch) at [CERN](https://cern.ch). My research is at the forefront of flavor physics, with a particular focus on B meson physics. Prior to this, I earned my Master’s degree at the [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu), where I delved into the enigmatic domain of Magnetic Monopoles. This elusive particle, steeped in human curiosity since antiquity, remains a puzzle yet to be solved. During my Master’s, I was also involved in the [NOvA experiment](https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/) at [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov). 

Currently I'm working on rare decay studies of B meson and LHCb trigger development. I'm working on the developing the infrastructure of integrating Machine Learning inference engines inside the LHCb data processing framework called [Allen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09161). I'm also part of [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/) initiative, which aims to develop and deploy sustainable software and services for the high-energy physics community with focus on LHC HL era.
